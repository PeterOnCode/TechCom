## Testing

1. [Karma Runner](https://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html)

  - The main goal for Karma is to bring a __productive testing environment__ to developers.
    - don't have to set up loads of configurations,
    - developers can just write the code and get instant feedback from their tests.
    - Because getting quick feedback is what makes you productive and creative.

  - In order to serve well, Karma needs to know about project in order to test it and this is done via a _configuration file_.
