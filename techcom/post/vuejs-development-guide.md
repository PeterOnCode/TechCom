## [What Makes Vue.js Unique?](https://www.monterail.com/vuejs-development-guide#what-makes-vue-js-unique)

Viable alternative to AngularJS and React.

> Vue is flexible, easy to learn, and powerful. Its ecosystem is still growing and it already has everything you need to build all kinds of applications (yes, mobile apps, too).

What are Vue’s main selling points that make developers and business owners select it as their technology of choice? What is so unique about it?

### :tada: Community-driven

- The core team currently has __twenty-two members__ to take care of the ecosystem growth.
- Its very beginning, __164 people__ from all over the world have contributed to the Vue.js repository.

### :tada: Progressive

Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.

It means that Vue.js is a framework that you can __progressively opt-in to__. Regardless of whether you _scale your app up or down_, it will work just as well for you and will stay _flexible_ in terms of tooling configuration, number of features, and team collaboration. For example, when a site’s complexity scales up, libraries like [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) and [Vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org) can be adopted incrementally.

### :tada: Easy to integrate

Ease of integration is the key advantage of Vue according to the survey results published in State of Vue.js

### :tada: Smooth learning curve

Know JavaScript reasonably well, you can get productive in a matter of hours in a mid-sized project.

### :tada: Time-efficient coding

 It allows you to use less code to achieve the same results, and that means less time spent on development and better cost efficiency.

### :tada: Flexible

_"Vue is much less opinionated than Angular, offering official support for a variety of build systems, with no restrictions on how you structure your application. Many developers enjoy this freedom, while some prefer having only one Right Way to build any application."_

### :tada: Has top-notch documentation
